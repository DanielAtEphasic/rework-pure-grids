Rework Pure Grids Change History
================================

0.3.0 (2014-01-02)
------------------

* Added support for omitting a `units` value, which enables generating only the
  media query rules for Pure's default 5ths and 24ths based grid unit sizes.
  This allows Pure's rollup `pure-min.css` file to be used along with customized
  media queries generated by this tool. ([#6][])

* Forced `includeOldIEWidths` option to `false` when generating the grid units
  rules inside of `@media { ... }` blocks because old version of IE don't
  support media queries. ([#5][])

------------------

* Added media query support. A collection of name -> query CSS media queries can
  now be specified via `options.mediaQueries`, and custom unit selectors will be
  generated with the `name` inside the `query`. ([#3][])
